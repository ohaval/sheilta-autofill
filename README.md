# Sheilta Autofill (and Auto Login)

This Chrome extension will automatically fill the Username, Password and the 
ID number on the Sheilta login page. If the AutoLogin option is enabled, 
the extension will also attempt to log in with the saved parameters.

**Use this feature with care**, as the parameters are not stored encrypted,
and with invalid credentials and multiple tries, you can be blocked from the site!

All of these parameters are configurable from the extension popup.
